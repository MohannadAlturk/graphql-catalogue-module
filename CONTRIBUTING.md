# Contributing to the OXID eSales GraphQL Catalogue Module

First off: Thank you for taking the time to contribute! ðŸ¥³

Before contributing for the first time, you must [sign the Contributor License Agreement](https://gist.github.com/OXID-Admin/6df6ed126d074a54507d). You can find more information about it on [OXID Contribution and Contributor Agreement FAQ](https://oxidforge.org/en/oxid-contribution-contributor-agreement-faq).

**Best practice:**

- Please leave the the branch names as they are.
- If you want to fix a bug or develop a new feature, define an own branch in your repository. Name it e.g. "feature/foo" or "bug/bugname" for better traceability.
- Change whatever you want and send a pull request back to the original branch.
